    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Nelly Perkins, a loyal, introspective extrovert (yes, we exist!) who thrives in cozy spaces, deep
        conversations, and thoughtful connections.</p>

    <p>I was born in Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico, on March 3rd. My roots have shaped me into a warm, giving person who
        values the little joys in life. Whether it’s letting a friend have the last slice of pizza or finding the
        perfect thoughtful gift, I believe in making people feel valued and cared for.
    </p>

    <p>When I walk with a group, I always stay at the back—not because I’m shy, but because I want to make sure no one
        is left behind. I’m deeply empathetic, often making excuses for people who may hurt me, convincing myself they
        didn’t mean it. My loyalty and care extend to everyone around me, and I’m constantly anxious about ensuring
        others feel comfortable.
    </p>

    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Pottery & Felting:</h3>
            <p>I love working with my hands, and pottery was once a big part of my life. I hope to return to the
                spinning wheel
                soon. Felting is a recent passion, and I've already made a star, a mushroom, and a fox!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Baking & Cake Decorating:</h3>
            <p>Baking is my happy place. From cookies to fantastical fondant cakes, I love turning desserts into edible
                art.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Pixel Art & Game Development:</h3>
            <p>I recently discovered pixel art, and it opened a door to coding and video game creation. I'm always eager
                to learn
                something new, and this has become a fun, exciting challenge for me.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Movies & Ghost Stories:</h3>
            <p>Movies that get my heart racing—whether a sweeping romance or a gripping horror—are my favorite. Also, I
                100%
                believe in ghosts (because they are real, of course), but UFOs? Not so much.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Dogs:</h3>
            <p>I'm a dog person at heart. My last dog, Whoopy—a sweet cocker spaniel—passed three years ago, and I hope
                to welcome
                a new furry friend into my life someday.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Thrifting & the 30-Day Rule:</h3>
            <p>I enjoy browsing thrift stores but rarely buy anything these days. I've learned to curb my impulsive
                shopping by
                following a simple rule: if I still want it after 30 days, I'll buy it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Driving & Singing:</h3>
            <p>My mom says I'm a great driver, and I'll take her word for it! While I'm no musician (despite trying
                guitar,
                ukulele, piano, and more), I love singing in the shower or while baking.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quirks and Personality</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I avoid dancing if I can help it.</li>
        <li>My humor can be dark, weird, and provocative at times.</li>
        <li>I have a “clean but not folded” chair for laundry—it's a permanent resident of my room.</li>
        <li>I don't believe I have a musical ear, but that doesn't stop me from singing.</li>
        <li>I love thrifting for the stories behind the items, even if I don't buy anything.</li>
        <li>My favourite colours are purple, and green</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Family & Life Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I have two brothers I adore: Carlos, my older brother, and Hugo, my younger one. My pride and joy is my son,
        Daniel,
        who brings so much light into my life.</p>

    <p>I believe in owning my mistakes and asking for forgiveness when I've done something wrong. I'm a big fan of
        learning
        and evolving, always seeking new skills or insights to better myself.</p>

    <p>At the end of the day, I'm a giver at heart—whether it's through thoughtful gifts, loyal friendship, or simply
        being
        there for the people I care about.</p>
